                    <p>I'm an extra pair of hands. I focus on advisory work and training rather than custom development. This means unbiased recommendations based solely on what works for your needs, without pressure to buy services you don't need.</p>
                    <p>If custom coding is required, I can recommend experienced developers. My role is strategic guidance — helping you understand your options and manage your site confidently.</p>
