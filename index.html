                <p><strong>You're worried about getting hacked.</strong> You hear about WordPress sites getting compromised, but you're not sure if yours is vulnerable. Updates pile up and you're afraid something will break if you touch it.</p>

                <p><strong>You need a site but don't know where to start.</strong> There are thousands of themes, plugins, and hosting options. How do you know which choices will support your business goals without becoming a liability later?</p>
                <p>I can advise on specific themes, plugins and hosting that are appropriate for the type of site you're looking to deliver and the way you're intending to manage it.</p>

                <p><strong>Your current site doesn't fit your business anymore.</strong> Your business has evolved but your site hasn't kept up. Or maybe you need to switch hosts, update your design, or migrate from another platform entirely.</p>
                <p>Moving hosts or updating your design? I can support complex migrations and redesigns.</p>

                <p><strong>You're making expensive decisions based on guesswork.</strong> Every plugin and hosting change feels like a gamble. You're spending money on tools you're not sure you need, or worse, avoiding investments that could actually help your business grow.</p>
                <p>I can advise on hosting, plugins, architecture, and best practices. Avoid costly mistakes and make informed decisions about your WordPress site.</p>

                <p><strong>You're stuck paying someone for every small change.</strong> Want to update a page? That'll be £150. Need to add a blog post? Wait for your developer. You're paying ongoing fees for simple tasks you could handle yourself if someone just showed you how.</p>
                <p>I can identify modifications you can make to your site to manage more of it yourselves and provide personalized training.</p>
